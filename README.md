a. This algorithm creates a list to check duplicate in list by declaring N to be the length and creates a
loop to check if i equals zero to N then checks with another loop if j
equals zero to N then if it does it will see if i is not equal to j list
then it will return true if it does have duplicate in list and if not it will return false.

b. The worst case running time of the algorithm is quadratic because it runs two loops for listing i and j
 inside the code.

c. The algorithm is still correct because it still runs because it checks the duplicates throughout both 
lists and still returns true if there isn't any duplicates and returns false if there is.

d. The algorithm will run twice as fast because it is a quadratic algorithm and as stated above it includes two 
lists that will loop through the code

e. Yes the time complexity of the algorithm is still quadratic as quadratic time complexity represents an 
algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the squared size of the input data set as the two lists.

f. O(n log n)

g. O(n) - I think that this is the time complexity of the 2nd algorithm
in big O notation because it looks like a linear algorithm as the 1st algorithm is quadratic and the time complexity
notation looks like this "O(nÂ²)" as it includes two for loops whereas the 2nd only includes one.

h. If the size of the input is larger the 2st algorithm would be faster because it only includes one loop checker
for the list whereas the other program has two for loops to check.

i. One main reason a programmer would choose a slower algorithm than a faster one in their program is that its more
 performance efficient with the code by being easier to read and maintain.
